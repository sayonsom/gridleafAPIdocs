# Resiliency Optimization API

Welcome to the API documentation for Gridleaf's post-event power system optimization. Our API enables you to optimize power distribution and recovery strategies after grid disruption events.

## Overview

The Resiliency Optimization API provides endpoints for:
- Optimizing fixed resource allocation
- Managing dynamic load balancing
- Integrating PMU data streams
- Analyzing system resilience metrics

> **Related APIs**: For pre-event risk assessment, see our [Power Outage Risk API](/docs/power-outage-risk-api) and [Vegetation Risk API](/docs/vegetation-risk-api) to identify potential grid vulnerabilities before they occur.

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. You can obtain your API key from the GridLeaf dashboard.

#### API Key Usage

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key
```

## Endpoints

### Fixed Resource Optimization

#### POST /optimize/fixed-resources

Optimizes usage of existing diesel generators and batteries for critical load maintenance.

> **Tip**: Use this endpoint in conjunction with the [Power Outage Risk API's](/docs/power-outage-risk-api) weather-outage endpoint to proactively prepare resources based on forecasted risks.

```json
{
  "critical_load_profile_kw": [2.5, 3.1],
  "generator_capacity_kw": 5.0
}
```

### PMU Data Integration

#### POST /pmu/integrate

Submit PMU data for real-time system analysis and optimization.

> **Note**: This endpoint's data can be valuable for the [Vegetation Risk API's](/docs/vegetation-risk-api) risk-analysis endpoint to correlate system performance with vegetation-related issues.

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.gridleaf.com/pmu/integrate",
    json={
        "pmu_readings": [
            {"timestamp": "2024-03-15T10:00:00Z", "voltage": 120.5},
            {"timestamp": "2024-03-15T10:00:01Z", "voltage": 120.3}
        ]
    }
)
```
